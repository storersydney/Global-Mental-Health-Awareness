# Global Mental Health Awareness

## Project Summary
This repository contains exploratory, regression, and cluster analyses on global mental health data. I chose this dataset because I am passionate about mental health and find it fascinating to see the percentages of populations in different countries dealing with mental illnesses. The goal is to shine a light on the global burden of disease for mental health disorders as well as the stigma surrounding mental health.

## Key Questions
* How has the prevalence of mental health disorders changed over time?
* How do mental health diagnoses affect DALYs (Disability-Affected Life Years)?
* How does the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders vary amongst different regions of the world?

## Data
Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/mental-health-dataset?select=share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders.csv  
It was unclear how this data was collected based on the Kaggle page, however with further research, I believe the data is based on the Global Burden of Disease Study. Based on exploration of an external website https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/, the data is collected in a variety of methods including from surveys as well as different medical facilities.

## Data Limitations
The stigma surrounding mental health disorders often leads to discrimination, misunderstanding, and reluctance to seek help, which can significantly impact data on mental health. Many people fear judgment or negative consequences if they disclose mental health struggles, resulting in underreporting. This stigma can distort data by minimizing the number of cases reported or leading to inaccurate self-assessment in surveys. Consequently, mental health statistics may not fully reflect the prevalence and severity of mental health disorders, which affects funding, resource allocation, and public policy decisions aimed at addressing these issues. Understanding and reducing this stigma is essential for more accurate data, which in turn supports better-informed interventions and resources for mental health care.
